RickMoranis climbs past me, heads for Kuxir and then suddenly seems to be fighting an invisible force, unable to progress well.

The two leaders suddenly start fighting it out before settling on the same score of 10664.

Every time I surprise one name (Yes it does) I eventually get dropped a point.

Now my own score is changing randomly.

All these bots and scripts and clickers - O brave new world!
