# Leaderboarder

## End of life

At some point the underlying platform this game relied upon, Meteor, changed in a way that caused it to become defunct. There's nothing to play anymore. You can still look at the documentation in the repository though:

## Description

Leaderboarder was made over the course of a sunny morning in April. It was written using [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) and extensively uses one of Meteor's example projects.

~~Leaderboarder was covered by [Warp Door](http://wip.warpdoor.com/2014/04/27/leaderboarder-pippin-barr/).~~
